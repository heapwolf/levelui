The event is described below.\n\n## `watchTree(dir, options, callback)` ##\n\nWatch a directory recursively, with some specific options. Currently, you can\nonly specify a single option:\n\n    { exclude: [] }\n\nThe `exclude` array specifies file patterns to exclude from watches. If a\npattern matches a directory, `watch-tree` will not recurse into it. If it\nmatches a file, changes to that file will not trigger an event.\n\nThe excludes can be either strings or regular expressions, but are always\ntreated as regular expressions. That means that\n\n    { exclude: [\".git\", \"node_modules\"] }\n\nWill be treated the same way as:\n\n    { exclude: [new RegExp(\".git\"), new RegExp(\"node_modules\")] }\n\nIf you only want to exclude specific files, be sure to provide full\npaths. `watch-tree` does not expand paths, it will resolve all paths relative to\nthe original directory. So this:\n\n    watchFile(\".git\", function (event) { /* ... *) });\n\nWill watch (and consider excludes for) directories like `.git/branches`. And\nthis:\n\n    watchFile(\"/home/christian/projects/watch-tree/.git\", function (event) {});\n\nWill watch (and consider excludes for) directories like\n`/home/christian/projects/watch-tree/.git`.\n\n## `event` ##\n\nThe event object has the following properties:\n\n### `name` ###\n\nThe full (relative) path to the file/directory that changed.\n\n### `isDirectory()` ###\n\nReturns true if the cause of the change was a directory. In some cases,\ne.g. when the directory was deleted, it's not possible to know if the\nsource was a directory. In that case, this method returns false.\n\n### `isMkdir()` ###\n\nReturns true if the cause of the event was a newly created directory.\n\n### `isDelete()` ###\n\nReturns true if the cause of the event was a deleted file/directory.\n\n### `isModify()` ###\n\nReturns true if the cause of the event was a modified file/directory.\n",
